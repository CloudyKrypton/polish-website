                    the strongest counter-proposals for Polish mentality, identity, and self-identifications 
                    (such as the Enlightenment, Positivism, and the Inter-war struggles for modernization).

                <p class="courses-text">A study of the development of the modernist cultural formation in Poland 
                    from the <i>fin de siècle</i> to the aftermath of WWII. Discussions about terminological 
                    wars and conflicting understandings of the culture of modernism are aided by important 
                    literary works of Polish modernism, literary theory, philosophy, and concepts developed 
                    by sociology and political science.

            <div class="courses-content">
                <p class="courses-text">The trajectories of Poland's intellectual and cultural traditions provide 
                    some useful examples of national and international transfers of ideas between historians, 
                    political thinkers, writers, and artists. Each time the course is offered, it focuses on
                     a selected few concepts, such as tolerance and freedom, Polish republicanism and liberalism, 
                     the idea of a nation, Polish religious thought, the role of intelligentsia and intellectual 
                     institutions, backwardness and modernization and culture wars of recent years. Our readings 
                     span from the 15 th to the 21 st centuries and pair political thinkers and historians with
                      writers and political and cultural theoreticians across the centuries in order to make their
                       ideas engage with and illuminate each other. Pawel Wlodkowic’s 15 th century ideas on 
                       freedom may be thus read together with Adam Mickiewicz's 19 th century Books or Bolesław 
                       Prus’s journalism, and with Józef Tischner’s 20 th-century reflection on post-1989 
                       condition of freedom. Our analysis of religious ideas can see the 16 th-century poems 
                       of Mikołaj Sęp-Szarzyński converse with Piotr Skarga’s fierce counter-reformation and 
                       Czesław Miłosz’s or Leszek Kołakowski’s essays. Such readings are placed within the 
                       theoretical discussions regarding intellectual history (e.g. Dominick LaCapra), and 
                       relations between such history and culture.

            <div class="courses-content">
                <p class="courses-text">The swift collapse of communist regimes across Central and Eastern Europe 
                    came as a surprise to both their opponents and political clients. While in 1989 Francis 
                    Fukuyama speculated in his most famous – and most derided – essay about the “end of history,” 
                    the historian Tony Judt saw in this chain of events a final release of the region’s histories 
                    from “what once seemed permanent and somehow inevitable” but now taking on “a more transient 
                    air.” Did the Central and Eastern European nations escape history (into vaguely defined, 
                    Western-style “normalcy”), or have now properly “entered it” as independent subjects? What 
                    social and cultural mechanisms shape the relationship to the communist and pre-communist 
                    past and visions of the – still largely indeterminate – future in the globalized world for 
                    these nations? How are we to think about the years following the rapid transformation from 
                    communism to neoliberal capitalism and more or less liberal democracy in countries like 
                    Poland, Ukraine, South Slavic Republics, and Russia? How did culture mediate the experience 
                    of this political, social, and economic revolution? Finally, what is the condition of 
                    post-communism? When does it begin? When – if at all – can it be said to have ended?
                </p>
                <p class="courses-text">
                    In this course we will try to answer these and similar questions while examining the 
                    literature and cinema of the so called “post-communist” cultures. Our methodology will 
                    build on theoretical apparatus and concepts developed by postcolonial (and post-dependency) 
                    studies, such as imperialism, cultural hegemony, relationships of power and dependency, 
                    (sub)alter(n)ity, hybridity, liminality, and others. We will discuss and critically 
                    evaluate the applicability of this methodology to the Central and Eastern European 
                    (in the case of Russia, also Eurasian) context, focusing on various strategies of identity 
                    (re)construction adopted by the authors and filmmakers amid the chaos of competing social, 
                    historical, and cultural narratives that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Empire and 
                    its satellites.

                <p class="courses-text">
                    In this course we will examine European science fiction, focusing on literature, drama, and 
                    film produced in Central and Eastern Europe. Shaped by the experience of two world wars, two 
                    totalitarianisms, and several revolutions, continental sci-fi is known for its radical and 
                    uncompromising thought experiments and daring aesthetics. We will discuss works by H.G. Wells,
                     Evgenii Zamiatin, Karel Čapek, Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, Fritz Lang, Stanisław Lem, Andrei 
                     Tarkovsky, Jacek Dukaj, and others against the cultural and theoretical background of 
                     modernity. We will base our methodology on the theoretical framework developed by science 
                     fiction studies, yet our focus in the course will be various strategies of re-enchanting the
                      modern world that European authors deploy in their texts.
