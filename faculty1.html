                <p class="biography-text">
                    A graduate of the Drama Centre at the University of Toronto (PhD) and of Theatre Studies at the 
                    Jagiellonian University in Kraków (MA), Tamara Trojanowska has also formerly held an Oxford University 
                    scholarship and an internship at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. She has taught at universities
                    in Poland, Canada, and the United States, returning to University of Toronto as a faculty member in 
                    1998. Since then, she has directed the Polish Language and Literature Program at the Slavic Department,
                    strengthening in strides its profile and presence in North America , as well as the University 
                    College Drama Program (2008-2012). In 2012, together with Stephen Johnson, then director of the 
                    Graduate Drama Centre, she integrated the two units to form the Center for Drama, Theatre and 
                    Performance Studies, with which she is cross-appointed. She now serves as Director of the Centre.
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">Her current research focuses on the intersections of drama and theatre with 
                    history and religious thought, and emphasizes issues of identity, subversion, and transgression, 
                    topics that she has published on in Poland, Canada, United States, and England. Her latest research 
                    project, co-edited with Joanna Niżyńska and Przemysław Czapliński and entitled A History of Polish 
                    Literature and Culture: New Perspectives on 20th and 21st Centuries, counts over 1350 pages and 
                    presents more than sixty essays by diverse authors from all over the world, including her extensive 
                    analysis of the transgressive practices in Polish drama and theatre ( “Delectatio furiosa, or the 
                    modes of cultural transgression”). She has also contributed a paper on this subject to the upcoming 
                    The Theatre of Tadeusz Kantor (eds. Magda Romanska and Cathleen Cioffi), with her investigations of 
                    the dramatic and the sacred resulting in a new selection of, and an extensive introduction to, the 
                    plays of Roman Brandstaetter (2016).

                <p class="biography-text">
                    Alongside her continuing administrative and research work, Trojanowska has served for five years 
                    as an elected member on the Executive Committee of the Division of Slavic and East European 
                    Literatures in Modern Languages Association and is an elected Board Member of the Polish Institute
