      <div class="content">
        <p>Henry Slaby was involved in Polish underground operations
          for which he was arrested by the Germans and sent to Auschwitz. When
          moved to Flosenburg, he escaped, joined the Polish Army in Italy and
          found himself in Great Britain after the war ended. In Britain he
          completed his education in business administration and became a
          Chartered Accountant. After coming to Canada in 1955, he settled in
          Toronto where in 1961 he started his own accounting business. In the
          1970s, Henry Slaby, by then a very successful, independent businessman,
          became involved in community service and politics. The list of his
          accomplishments in these areas is very impressive. He chaired multiple
          fundraising committees and was essential to completing the fundraising
          tasks both in Poland and in Canada. His involvement in Poland includes
          the restoration of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, a multimillion dollar
          fundraising for the John Paul Collegium Building at the Catholic
          University of Lublin, and recently the development of the Canadian
          Studies Program at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. The Canadian
          initiatives include the establishment of the Polish TV program and the
          Polish theater, the building of the Polish senior house (Copernicus
          Lodge), the Maximilian Kolbe Foundation and the building of the John
          Paul II Polish Cultural Center in Mississauga, the fundraising for the
          Chair of Polish History, many years of active participation in the
          Władysław and Nelli Turzański Foundation, and the establishment of the
          Slaby and Ungar Fund for the Polish Language and Literature Program at
          UofT. Henry Slaby was also actively involved in provincial and federal
          politics (Liberal Party) as CFO, agent and auditor. His many
          accomplishments were honored by the Queen (Outstanding Citizen Medal),
          the Provincial and Municipal authorities, the Catholic University of
          Lublin (Gold Medal for services and Doctor Honoris Causa as well as the
          title of Protector Universitatis), government of Poland (Commander's
          Cross of the Order of Merit with Star), and by the Holy Father, John
          Paul II (the Honor of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the
          Great).</p>
