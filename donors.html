        <h1>Our donors</h1>
        <p> The Polish Language and Literature Program gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the following:

        <br>
        <p><h4 align="center">Slaby-Ungar Endowment Fund for Polish Language and Literature</h4>created by Henry Slaby and Irene Ungar specially for the purpose of financing the Polish language courses</p><br>
        
        	<p class="p"><img class="s" src="Images/slaby.jpg" width="130" height="145" hspace="10" align="left"><strong>Henry Slaby</strong> (1925-2014)<br>
            Henry Slaby was involved in Polish underground operations
            for which he was arrested by the Germans and sent to Auschwitz. When
            moved to Flosenburg, he escaped, joined the Polish Army in Italy and
            found himself in Great Britain after the war ended. In Britain he
            completed his education in business administration and became a
            Chartered Accountant. After coming to Canada in 1955, he settled in
            Toronto where in 1961 he started his own accounting business. In the
            1970s, Henry Slaby, by then a very successful, independent businessman,
            became involved in community service and politics. The list of his
            accomplishments in these areas is very impressive. He chaired multiple
            fundraising committees and was essential to completing the fundraising
            tasks both in Poland and in Canada. His involvement in Poland includes
            the restoration of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, a multimillion dollar
            fundraising for the John Paul Collegium Building at the Catholic
            University of Lublin, and recently the development of the Canadian
            Studies Program at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. The Canadian
            initiatives include the establishment of the Polish TV program and the
            Polish theater, the building of the Polish senior house (Copernicus
            Lodge), the Maximilian Kolbe Foundation and the building of the John
            Paul II Polish Cultural Center in Mississauga, the fundraising for the
            Chair of Polish History, many years of active participation in the
            Władysław and Nelli Turzański Foundation, and the establishment of the
            Slaby and Ungar Fund for the Polish Language and Literature Program at
            UofT. Henry Slaby was also actively involved in provincial and federal
            politics (Liberal Party) as CFO, agent and auditor. His many
            accomplishments were honored by the Queen (Outstanding Citizen Medal),
            the Provincial and Municipal authorities, the Catholic University of
            Lublin (Gold Medal for services and Doctor Honoris Causa as well as the
            title of Protector Universitatis), government of Poland (Commander's
            Cross of the Order of Merit with Star), and by the Holy Father, John
            Paul II (the Honor of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the
            Great).</p>

Ungar</strong> (1916-2002)<br>
            nee Kolankiewicz, wife of Wacław Ungar, a
            Squadron Leader of the Polish Air Force, a participant in the Battle of
            Britain. She left Poland in 1939 and her journey through Romania,
            Yugoslavia, Italy, France and Portugal brought her to Canada in 1941.
            She was fluent in five languages and had a remarkable professional
            career spanning from intelligence service for the Allies during the
            war, through journalism, administration, immigration services,
            diplomacy, and finally to her position as a Canadian Citizenship judge.
            She was a philanthropist, a community leader, and a great patriot. Her
            many involvements included several Boards of Directors: of the
            Copernicus Lodge and International Institute of Metropolitan Toronto.
            She was chairing or vice-chairing important organizations:
            Polish-Canadian Congress (Toronto District), Canadian Polish Women
            Federation, Academic Disciplinary Tribunal at UofT, and the Advisory
            Board of the Community Folk Arts Council of Metropolitan Toronto. She
            was essential in establishing the Slaby/Ungar Fund for the Polish
            Language and Literature Program at UofT. She received an honorary
            membership in the Association of Polish Engineers in Canada and gold
            insignia of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association. For her
            leadership and life accomplishments she was awarded the gold medal of
            the Canadian-Polish Congress, the Medal of Service of the Order of
            Canada, the Golden Cross of Merit (from the Polish government in
            exile), and a medal Sursum Corda from the government of the Polish
            Republic for her life contribution to culture and community service.</p>

<h4 align="center">A gift from Veterans of the Polish Second Corps of the Eighth Army to the Polish Language and Literature Program at the University of Toronto </h4><br>
            <p class="p"><img src="Images/veterans.jpg" width="550" height="250" hspace="10" align="left" class="s">
            <p class="p">
            At a ceremony in April, 2016, Veterans of the Polish Second Corps of the Eighth Army presented the university with a 
            cheque for $50,000 to support the Polish Language and Literature Program at U of T.
            </p>
            <p class="p">“Four generations owe peace, freedom and prosperity to these men and their brothers-in-arms who died on the fronts of World
             War II. Today, to those priceless gifts they are adding one more — their generous support for the Polish Language and 
             Literature Program at the University of Toronto. Theirs is a generation of truly unmatched givers.”</p>

<p><h4 align="center"> Borys Wrzesnewskyj's gift to the Polish Studies at the University of Toronto</h4></p><br>
            <p class="p"><img src="Images/Wrzesnewskyj.jpeg" width="255" height="176" hspace="10" align="left" class="s">
            A $35,000 gift from Borys Wrzesnewskyj, MP for
            Etobicoke Centre and owner of Future Bakery and M-C Dairy, and his
            family will support the teaching of Polish language at the University
            of Toronto. The gift, which establishes the Roman Wrzesnewskyj Polish
            Endowment Fund , pays tribute to Mr. Wrzesnewskyj's father, who passed
            away in 2009. Mr. Wrzesnewskyj presented the gift to the University at
            a special reception held at the home of the Polish Consul General in
            Toronto on December 17. 
            <br><br>
            Canada's Polonia community, of which Mr. Wrzesnewskyj is a
            distinguished member, has played a significant role in building this
            country and strengthening its cultural mosaic ever since the first
            major Polish-group settlers arrived in Ontario in the 19 th century.
            They include such notables as Alexandre Édouard Kierzkowski, the first
            MP of Polish descent who served in Canada's inaugural parliament, and
            the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have worked as labourers
            and professionals in every sector. Among them are Mr. Wrzesnewskyj's
        	grandfather, Felix, who founded Future Bakery, and his father, Roman.
            <br><br>
            “I fondly remember my father patiently teaching me and correcting my
            Polish,” says Mr. Wrzesnewskyj. “It is with the contributions of Polish
            Canadians to Canada in mind that our family is making this contribution
            to the Polish Endowment Fund at U of T. And it is with fond memories of
        my late father, Roman, that it is being named in his honour.” </p>
